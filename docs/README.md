At first glance, it may appear *SnapBack* is complicated to set up and use. Be assured this is **not** the case - at least not if you are not completely new to Linux backups and snapshots, and maybe spend a few minutes to grasp the basic *Terms & Concepts* first.

Do not get confused by all the features and options! Versatility was a major goal, so quite a lot is there for very specific demands.
There is a good chance a basic, straightforward configuration well fits for your case(s).
