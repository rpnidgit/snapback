# Changelog

>[!NOTE]
>*SnapBack* was started in April 2024 and has been in regular use on a number of systems since shortly thereafter.  
>Since these systems are hardly representative for "the wider public", 0.95.0 was chosen as the initial public version number.
It will be bumped to 1.0.0, and proper [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) used thereafter,
once wider feedback got digested and any significant "environmental myopia" based flaws resolved.
